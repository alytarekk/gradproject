# gradproject
The purpose of this project is to colorize sketch images of interiour designs and make them be colorized and caption the image to give description to it. this project includes GAN networks, feature fusion networks, mobilenet-ssd-v2 model and a large language model api. to clarify the GAN would take the sketch images and convert them to a RGB image, then the skecth and the RGB image would be inserted into the feature fusuion network in order to enhance the generated image's quality, then the generated image would be placed into the mobile-ssd-v2 object detection model in order to extract objects inside the generated image, the extracted objects would be placed on a list as tokens and be sent to the large language model(LLM) api and the LLM would generate a caption that would fit the image . This repository contains all files of our grad project where we show code of data preprocessing (data extraction, data conversion, naming) , training, validation, testing, and the overall pipeline.
