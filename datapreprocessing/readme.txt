this subfolder will contain ipynb code that shows how we have done data-preprocessing.
note: We have used the interourNet dataset which was mounted on our google Drive +  all of our data is images
to further explain the data-preprocessing. the data-preprocessing was done in a number of steps which contained the extraction of RGB images from the interiournet dataset.
the extraction had decompressed folders then entered to cam0 subfolder in the interiournet dataset  and putting them in a folder of our own.
then when around 100000 images were collected we have put them in a code that converted them into sketch resulting in 100000 pairs.
then the 100000 pairs were split for training/validation/testing.
